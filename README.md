# Cognifyz_Internship Project Overview

During my Data Science internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, I worked on a series of data exploration, analysis, and machine learning tasks designed to apply real-world data science concepts. The projects ranged from data preprocessing to building predictive models, offering a comprehensive learning experience in AI, machine learning, and data analytics.

### 1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - **Objective**: Performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset by identifying the structure of the data, handling missing values, and analyzing class distributions for target variables.
   - **Key Tasks**:
     - Checked the dataset for missing values and handled them accordingly.
     - Converted data types as needed and ensured consistency across variables.
     - Analyzed the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate Rating") to identify any class imbalances.

### 2. **Descriptive and Geospatial Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Conducted descriptive statistics and geospatial analysis to gain insights into the distribution of restaurants and their ratings.
   - **Key Tasks**:
     - Computed statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
     - Explored categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
     - Visualized the geographic distribution of restaurants using latitude and longitude, identifying any correlations between location and rating.

### 3. **Price Range and Feature Engineering**
   - **Objective**: Analyzed the price ranges of restaurants and engineered additional features to improve model performance.
   - **Key Tasks**:
     - Identified the most common price ranges and calculated the average rating for each.
     - Created new features like "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.
     - Extracted additional features like the length of restaurant names and addresses.

### 4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - **Objective**: Built and evaluated regression models to predict the aggregate ratings of restaurants.
   - **Key Tasks**:
     - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to build a regression model for predicting ratings.
     - Experimented with multiple algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest**, comparing their performance using various evaluation metrics.

### 5. **Customer Preference and Data Visualization**
   - **Objective**: Analyzed customer preferences based on cuisine types and created visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.
   - **Key Tasks**:
     - Identified the most popular cuisines and analyzed their impact on restaurant ratings.
     - Created data visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots to represent key insights, such as the relationship between restaurant features and customer ratings.

## Key Skills Acquired
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and class imbalance analysis.
- **Descriptive & Geospatial Analysis**: Performing statistical analysis, visualizing geospatial data, and identifying correlations between location and ratings.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data to enhance model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict restaurant ratings.
- **Data Visualization**: Crafting insightful charts and plots (histograms, bar plots) to visualize data trends and relationships.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geospatial Mapping Tools.
